# Musicians-Pool-Management
 The system takes input for a number of performances, each described in the following format:

Performance Details:
Performance Name (a single word)
Performance Date: mm:hh yyyy mm dd (month:hour year month day)
List of Musical Instruments required for the performance:
Instrument Name
Number of Instruments needed
Importance (1 if important, 0 if not)
The system will then attempt to assign musicians for each performance based on the musicians' database and various parameters like availability and the required number of musicians. If successful, the system will provide the following details:

Performance Name
Performance Date: mm:hh yyyy mm dd
List of Musicians with the following information for each musician:
Full Name
Instrument to be played
Price charged by the musician
The total price of the show will also be displayed.

If the system cannot find suitable musicians to fulfill the requirements of a performance, it will print a message indicating that the performance cannot be held.

The system automates the process of musician selection and aims to efficiently organize performances while considering musician availability and the number of musicians needed for each instrument.
